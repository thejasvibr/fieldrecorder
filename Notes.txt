Verified as of commit 3edd0.. : The sync signal output from channel 1 and the cross-device sync signal are both 100 % synchronised. 

TO DO : write script which :
	> compares the cross-device signal and estimates delay
	> cuts out the channels accordingly and saves them all into separate files 
	> upsamples them all to 500 KHz
