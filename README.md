# fieldrecorder
### A set of scripts that allow for dongle-free recording and playback triggered by keyboard presses. 
### This script is used to record audio from a 24 channel recording system and to playback a common signal which triggers synchronised camera frame capture and recording. 

### The functions in  the ADC_delay module help in compensating the AD conversion delay across the two 12 -channel devices used to record the 24 channels. 

### fieldrecorder runs with help from the sounddevice library
